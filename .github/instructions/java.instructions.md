applyTo: *.java
---
- don't use deprecated apis
- always remove unused imports
- use imports instead of fully qualified class names
- prefer multiple simpler lines to one complex line
- use """ text blocks for any DB query having a JOIN or ≥2 WHERE clauses
- use Java SE APIs over writing custom code
- never use "this" to reference instance fields
- consider records instead of classes with final fields
- add factory methods in records instead of passing null in constructors
- avoid comments - prefer extracting well-named constants, local variables, methods or classes
- comments in code should be applied for: cron expressions and regex patterns
- do not write obvious JavaDoc /** that rephrase code - document the intention, the "why", not implementation details
- use constants to explain magic numbers and strings, or to avoid repeating the same domain value
- decompose complex boolean conditions with explanatory variables
- use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables
- avoid else statements when not necessary, unless the if is the last statement of the function
- avoid meaningless suffixes: *Impl, *Manager, *Creator, *Factory
- Keep methods small (ideally <=20 lines) and flat (max 3 level of indentation)
- use Cuard Clauses to return or throw early from a function, to reduce the code indentation.
- use explicit type for variables instead of `var` if an explanatory name is too long (>3 words)
- watch out for NullPointerException when the source of data can't be verified (such as coming from a REST payload)
- avoid checked exceptions; if thrown by library code, rethrow them wrapped in a runtime exception
- do not create interfaces implemented by a single class; use classes directly
- create multiple classes only if it decreases complexity and increases readability
- Avoid getter methods starting with "get"; prefer record convention (e.g., name() not getName())
- create well-named methods for coarse-grained, cohesive, self-contained logic
- If a lambda requires multiple statements or braces {}, extract it into a well-named helper method
- Do not create multiline lambda expressions; prefer method references instead
- Extract repeated logic into helper methods (DRY principle)
- Avoid creating empty delegate methods which just call methods without added value
- extract variables to eliminate duplication
- prefer enums over plain Strings for finite, well-defined values
- reuse enum constants as values if possible; enum constants do not have to follow naming conventions
- use try-with-resources instead of explicitly closing resources
- to produce a collection, use Stream instead of a 'for' adding to an empty collection
- prefer .toList() to .collect(Collectors.toList()), if the returned list is not mutated later
- prefer List.of() over new ArrayList<>()
- avoid long Stream chains - after 3-4 operators extract a variable or a method
