# Project Guidelines

## Ground Rules 
- keep your explanations concise as for an experienced programmer
- prefer bullet lists, numbered lists, and tables for higher signal / noise ratio
- avoid long paragraphs of text to protect my flow and save my brain energy
- I might type incorrect or use incorrect words as I often dictate using a voice-to-text tool 
- if my prompt is ambiguous or seems wrong, you MUST challenge it!
- ask questions when unclear, flag contradictions, point out mistakes
- if a task involves changing more than 1 file and there are any pending uncommited changes, ask user if you should commit them first
- if you learn something important about my project context that can help you later, ask me if I allow you to update the global instructions file, to save time for next task
- when I ask you to refactor, make sure you run the tests
